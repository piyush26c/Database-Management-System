#Connectivity steps
OS : (Debian) Ubuntu 16.04
IDE : Eclipse - OXYGEN

Note : Current repository contains the mongodb_jdbc_connectivity code(19.txt) which works with the driver uploaded in this repository,
       catch is as you change the driver method definitions and implemention changes hence provided code will only run for provide driver.

step-1 : create new Java Project.
step-2 : By right clicking on the project file at left corner of IDE(Package Explorer), there will be an option available called Build path.
step-3 : In Build Path go to Add external archives, it will ask you the path of archives(JAR files) which are to be included,
         include any one of the JAR file(mongo-java-drivers) I have provided in this current repository.
step-4 : Here you are done you can see all the packages and their class in Package Explorer - Reference Libraries.
step-5 : Type the code(19.txt) provided in this current repositry and you are done!!!
